#Distance measurement using HC-SR04 using software triggered pulses.

#Tasks:
#Analyse the effect of time sleep in line 30
#Analayse the correlation of trigger signal and the echo signal
#Extend the code to measure the repeatability of the measurement
#Improve the repeatability by averaging. What is the effect on time resolution.
